This is a relatively simple (but complete) app that simultaenously demos several things:

1. how to build a multicolor spinning triangle in OpenGl ES 3.x that occupies only a portion of the user screen

2. how to build a C++ routine to generate sentences and the JNI involved in the communication between Java and C++

3. illustrates proper handling of data state in between screen rotations
